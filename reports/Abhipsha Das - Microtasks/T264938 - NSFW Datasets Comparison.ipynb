    "## Datasets Survey for T264045: Not Safe for Work (NSFW) media Classifier for Wikimedia Commons\n",
    "\n",
    "NSFW (or Not Safe for Work) is an internet slang that arose out of utility to communicate and indicate a certain type of visual data that may be sexual(explicit or suggestive), violent or harmful content to view in non-casual, professional environments. As such, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Not_safe_for_work) defines it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Not safe for work (NSFW) is Internet slang or shorthand used to mark links to content, videos or websites pages the viewer may not wish to be seen looking at in a public, formal or controlled environment. The marked content may contain nudity, intense sexuality, political incorrectness, profanity, slurs, violence or other potentially disturbing subject matter. Environments that may be problematic include workplaces, schools, and family settings. NSFW has particular relevance for people trying to make personal use of the Internet at workplaces or schools which have policies prohibiting access to sexual and graphic subject matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Conversely, safe for work (SFW) is used for links that don't contain such material, but where the title might otherwise lead people to think that content is NSFW. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, it has become a significant endeavour by data scientists, web-based companies and aware individuals alike to work towards improving the identification of NSFW media and content in order to ensure greater safety in while browsing the internet or using web services in public and professional environments. Towards this, a lot of research has been conducted that necessarily requires curation and publication of the datasets that were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, I will comparing some of the datasets that are commonly used to train NSFW classifiers, and some lesser known ones as well, all of which are freely accessible or after obtaining permission from the dataset curators. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. [NPDI Pornography Database](https://sites.google.com/site/pornographydatabase/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a popular database used by most researchers to test their novel NSFW classification architectures. The Pornography database contains nearly 80 hours of 400 pornographic and 400 non-pornographic videos. The database consists of several genres of pornography and depicts actors of many ethnicities, including multi-ethnic ones. For the non-pornographic class, we have browsed general-public purpose video network and selected two samples: 200 videos chosen at random (which we called \"easy\") and 200 videos selected from textual search queries like \"beach\", \"wrestling\", \"swimming\", which we knew would be particularly challenging for the detector (called \"difficult\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Class |\tVideos  |\tHours   | \tShots per Video                  \n",
    "------|---------|-----------|------------------\n",
    "Porn  |\t400 |\t57 |\t15.6\n",
    "Non-porn (\"easy\") |\t200 |\t11.5 |\t33.8\n",
    "Non-porn (\"difficult\") |\t200 |\t8.5 |\t17.5\n",
    "All videos |\t800 |\t77 |\t20.6\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethnicity distribution of the content:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethnicity |\t % of Videos\n",
    "-------------|----------\n",
    "Asians |\t16%\n",
    "Blacks |\t14%\n",
    "Whites |\t46%\n",
    "Multi-ethnic |\t24%\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an extensive database with meticulously curated video data. With its broad categories of data and diversity in the content, this has been widely accepted and used as the go-to database for training NSFW classifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons: \n",
    "\n",
    "This database is available for use only for research and as such may be obtained by contacting them and stating our reasons for using. It is necessary to sign a license agreement to get access to the data (videos, video segments and frames), which needs to be printed, signed, scanned and sent to them for review. While not completely closed-source, it nevertheless requires individuals to obtain access permission and provide personal details. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. [Pornography-2k dataset](https://recodbr.wordpress.com/code-n-data/#porno)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pornography-2k dataset is an extended version of the NPDI dataset. The dataset comprises nearly 140 hours of 1,000 pornographic and 1,000 non-pornographic videos, which varies from six seconds to 33 minutes. Pornography-2k dataset is very assorted, including both professional and amateur content. Moreover, it depicts several genres of pornography, from cartoon to live action, with diverse behavior and ethnicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "This appears to be a hugely vast database and will be useful for training NSFW classifiers, on the condition that ample SFW images are integrated and a combined database of both categories is curated. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons: \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is not open-sourced and freely accessible. Researchers interested in getting this dataset have to contact the curators to request access to this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. [Adult Pornography Database](http://gvis.unileon.es/dataset/apd-2m/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adult Pornography Dataset comprises around 2 million pornographic images curated at the University of Leon, Spain. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "This appears to be a hugely vast database and will be useful for training NSFW classifiers, on the condition that ample SFW images are integrated and a combined database of both categories is curated. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons: \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is available only for research purposes. Researchers interested in getting this dataset have to contact them to request access to this dataset, explaining their contact and the purpose they want the dataset for.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. [NSFW Data Scraper](https://github.com/alex000kim/nsfw_data_scraper)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a open-sourced project hosted on GitHub that utilizes data scrapers to scrape NSFW media. As stated by the author, it is a set of scripts that allows for an automatic collection of tens of thousands of images for the following (loosely defined) categories to be later used for training an image classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "    porn - pornography images\n",
    "    hentai - hentai images, but also includes pornographic drawings\n",
    "    sexy - sexually explicit images, but not pornography. Think nude photos, playboy, bikini, etc.\n",
    "    neutral - safe for work neutral images of everyday things and people\n",
    "    drawings - safe for work drawings (including anime)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The individual scrapers can all be run by pulling and running the docker image of this project. After some hours all the data gets downloaded to our local system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros: \n",
    "\n",
    "It is open-source and easily accessible, requires only a few commands to pull, run and build from docker to have all the data downloaded locally. More scraping scripts can be added to the folders to collaborate and create more extensive datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons: \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a noisy dataset that needs to go through various steps of preprocesing and cleaning before it can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. [NSFW data source URLs](https://github.com/EBazarov/nsfw_data_source_urls)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a GitHub repository containing lists of URLs that will help in downloading NSFW images. This set can be added with SFW datasets to create a combined dataset train robust NSFW classification model. \n",
    "The dataset is divided into 159 different categories with a total of 1,589,331 URLs. After downloading and cleaning we obtain nearly 1,300,000 of NSFW images (~500 GB).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is open-source and freely accessible tool to scrape a vast amount of NSFW media. It is simple to operate too\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data after being scraped needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. [Nsfw | Scrolller](https://scrolller.com/nsfw) (Explicit site, open with caution)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a web resource containing NSFW images, gifs and videos created from NSSFW sureddits and hosted at this website. The images can be downloaded by crawling the website or using scraping tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is freely available and accessible to all 18+ aged humans. The data quality is very high and extremely unambiguous, which is useful for categorising under explicit porn category while curating our own dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a lot of the NSFW content online is of ambiguous quality, this dataset by itself cannot be useful owing to its high and precise quality of visual data. This data needs to be augmented after adding additional low quality NSFW content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. [GantMan's Dataset](https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an extensive dataset curated by GantMan and open-sourced on GitHub along with the implementation of their NSFW classifier. The project repository contains website scrapers that automatically download images and store them in the `images` folder when cloned and run locally. The dataset has been dvided into these categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "    drawings - safe for work drawings (including anime)\n",
    "    hentai - hentai and pornographic drawings\n",
    "    neutral - safe for work neutral images\n",
    "    porn - pornographic images, sexual acts\n",

    "\n",
    "amounting to 60+ GB of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is open-sourced and freely accessible. The dataset on downloading is made made by combining SFW images with NSFW content. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons: \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comes with the NSFW classfier implementation. The whole project needs to be cloned and run in order let the scraping scripts download the images and store them locally. The dataset needs to be cleaned, preprocessed and augmented before it can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. [NudeNet_classifier_dataset_v1](https://archive.org/download/NudeNet_classifier_dataset_v1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The author Praneeth Bedapudi has curated a dataset combining images of both SFW and NSFW category by crawling subreddits, [Scrolller](https://scrolller.com/nsfw), PornHub thumbnails, [nsfw_data_scraper](https://github.com/alex000kim/nsfw_data_scraper) and Facebook. It is a comprehensive resource containing:\n",
    "\n",
    ">   NSFW images: 1,78,601 from PornHub, 1,21,644 from Reddit and 1,30,266 from [GantMan’s](https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model) dataset\n",
    "\n",
    ">    SFW images: 68,948 from Facebook, 98,359 from [GantMan’s](https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model) dataset and 55,137 from Reddit\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a great resource curated with ample SFW content. The images have been augmented too which is extremely useful. It seems like the ideal dataset to test inital stage classifier models, when structuring the architecture of the proposed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Have to check for duplicate data and eliminate them, also further checking and cleaning required by the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Gore/Violence datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The websites dedicated to gore media such as [Gore](https://www.gore.com.b), [BestGore](https://www.bestgore.com/) and [GoreBrasil](https://www.gorebrasil.com) can be used. Using crawling techniques and web scraping tools we can scrape data from these online albums for curating our dataset and adding gore content to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "To supplement our findings and create an even more comprehensive data resource, it is useful that we ourselves scrape websites for visual content as well as preprocess and augment them. Towards this end, some popular scraping tools should be used to enhance our database. I have listed a few that can be very useful while curating our own database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. [RipMe](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme)\n",
    "\n",
    "RipMe is an open-sourced album ripper for various websites. It is a cross-platform GUI tool that requires Java 8, and can be run on Windows, Linux and MacOS. It quickly downloads images from any online album or image hosting platform after specifying the URL of that website in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "List of supported sites:\n",
    "\n",
    "> imgur, twitter, tumblr, instagram, flickr, photobucket, reddit, gonewild, motherless, imagefap, imagearn, seenive, vinebox, 8muses, deviantart, xhamster\n",
    "\n",
    "However, RipMe does not support any feature to restrict the amount of data to be downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also an open-sourced command line tool to download image-galleries and collections from several image hosting sites. It is a cross-platform tool with many configuration options and powerful filenaming capabilities. It requires Python 3.4+ to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "List of supported sites can be seen [here](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.rst).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. [Augmentor](https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an open-source image augmentation library in Python for machine learning. It implements the most real-world relevant augmentation techniques and employs a stochastic approach using building blocks that allow for operations to be pieced together in a pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a very useful library to have to augment datasets, and is used by writing Python scripts and importing the Augmentor library. It uses multi-threading to speed up the augmentation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other resources and methods like [Gemini](https://macpaw.com/geminihttps://www.snorkel.org) and [image hashing](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/04/20/detect-and-remove-duplicate-images-from-a-dataset-for-deep-learning/) to remove duplicate images can be used to preprocess and prepare the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### I have NOT included the datasets used by authors of NSFW classifier research papers who have described but not open-sourced their datasets or given a permission-based arrangement for obtaining it, as the accessibility of such datasets cannot be counted upon.  I have however reviewed the NSFW classifiers published by these researchers in the other Microtask(T264056).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "[Rule 34](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rule_34) is an internet meme that states that internet pornography exists concerning every conceivable topic and as such it is very difficult to curate a dataset and create a classifier after training using said dataset and expect it to accurately determine NSFW in every scenario. Yet, it is possible to create one using a dataset that at least conforms to the conventionally understood content of nudity, pornography, obscenity and violence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a combination of the NPDI Database, and images from the online albums and scrapers listed above, it is possible to create a comprehensive dataset to train our model on."
